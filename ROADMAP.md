# Roadmap / Wishlist

Not-yet-committed ideas and deferred work for **Markdown Midget**. This is a
living document — items move up, down, or off as priorities shift. Shipped work
lives in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Rough buckets: **Next** (likely soon), **Later** (wanted, not scheduled),
**Someday / Big** (real projects), **Won't unless asked** (known limits we've
deliberately parked).

## Someday / Big

### Real installer / uninstaller

A proper signed installer (MSI or MSIX) and an Add/Remove-Programs-visible
uninstaller, replacing the current portable-exe + "Register as .md editor"
AppData-install flow. Candidates: WiX (MSI, full control), MSIX (store-style
servicing, but packaging constraints on WebView2/file-association UX). The
in-app updater (Help ▸ About, 0.6.0) covers keeping users current until this
lands; the installer should absorb the updater's swap/registration logic rather
than duplicate it. Not started — parked deliberately until the update flow has
proven itself in the wild.

### Multi-document tabs

Tabbed editing with `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` and `Ctrl+PgUp` / `Ctrl+PgDn`
to switch (a reflex several testers have). Currently one document per window.

## Later

- **Spell check follow-ups** (the 0.5.0 stack shipped en-US only, app-private
  dictionary): language selection, and an optional one-way "import words from
  Word's CUSTOM.DIC" — import only, never write back. Sharing the OS dictionary
  was considered and deliberately rejected as too risky.

- **Find & Replace.** Find is done (4 modes, F3/Shift+F3); add the Replace tab —
  Replace / Replace All, scoped to selection, honoring the current search mode.
- **.NET 8 build + portable self-contained build.** The multi-target plan (net8 /
  net10 / portable ~63 MB) is scoped and the code already compiles for net8; just
  needs the csproj multi-target + extra publish profiles + release-workflow matrix.
- **Editor round-trip test harness.** The HTML sanitize policy and the C#
  image-serving boundary now have unit tests, but the markdown **load → edit →
  serialize round-trip** (Milkdown/ProseMirror) is still only covered by manual
  dogfooding. A proper test needs the full editor mounted in jsdom (ProseMirror +
  all Milkdown plugins) — more an integration harness than a smoke test. Worth
  building before relying on it for regression safety on parser/serializer changes.
- **Editor bundle lazy-load.** Mermaid pulled the bundle from ~560 KB to ~3.9 MB
  (exe 2.9 → 6.4 MB). Code-split Mermaid so it loads only when a `mermaid` block
  is present — switches esbuild to ESM chunks + adapts the HTML/extraction.
